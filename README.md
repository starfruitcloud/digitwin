`DT-SDK` is based on the open source project `Cesium` for the second development of two three-dimensional `WebGis` application framework , the framework optimizes the use of `Cesium` and adds some additional features , designed for developers to quickly build `WebGis` application.

```warning
Tipsï¼šThis SDK is JS+GIS framework package. Developers need to have some front-end technology and GIS related technology
```


## Run examples

```shell
  yarn run build
  yarn run server
```

## Installation

`NPM / YARN` **_`(Recommend)`_**

Installing with NPM or YARN is recommended and it works seamlessly with webpack.

```shell
yarn add @starfruitcloud/digitwin
-------------------------
npm install @starfruitcloud/digitwin
```

```js
import * as DT from '@starfruitcloud/digitwin'
import '@starfruitcloud/digitwin/dist/dt.min.css'
```

`CDN`

[Resources](https://github.com/starfruitcloud/digitwin/releases)

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@starfruitcloud/digitwin/dist/dt.min.js"></script>
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@starfruitcloud/digitwin/dist/dt.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
/>
```

```
Please put the resources in the project root directory libs/dt-sdk, if you put it in other directory, the framework will not run properly.
```

## Configuration

> The configuration is mainly used in the `NPM / YARN` way

Since the `DT` framework sets `CESIUM_BASE_URL` to `./libs/dt-sdk/resources/` , you need to copy `Cesium` related static resources files: `Assets` , `Workers` , `ThirdParty `to `libs/dt-sdk/resources` directory of the project to ensure that the 3D scene can be rendered properly. You can also use `DT.config.baseUrl` to set the static resource base related to `Cesium` .

`Webpack`

[Project Template](https://github.com/cavencj/dt-vue-app)

```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path')
const CopywebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')
const dvgisDist = './node_modules/@starfruitcloud'

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new CopyWebpackPlugin([
      {
        from: path.join(dvgisDist, 'dt-sdk/dist/resources'),
        to: 'libs/dt-sdk/resources',
      },
    ]),
  ],
}
```

## Start

```js
DT.ready(()=>{
    let viewer = new DT.Viewer()
})
```
